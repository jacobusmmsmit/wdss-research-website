## Summer Research Projects - What Are They About ?

As a WDSSâ€™s summer researcher, you will be immersed in either group or independent work for one of the presented project proposals. We offer access to resources and support from experienced data scientists and subject ambassadors with specific domain expertise. There are many types of projects you can get involved in including, but not limited to:
- Applying novel data science techniques in unseen ways
- Analysis of a specific dataset
- Computer simulation 
- Development of an interactive data visualisation/web app

The level of difficulty of each project varies. We offer projects which are suitable both for beginners and more advanced Data Science enthusiasts.

## Types of Projects

### Interdisciplinary Data Science
One of the primary goals of WDSS is to bring together people from various backgrounds who are keen on data science. If you are interested in applying data science to a problem from your specific area of interest, then WDSS's Summer Research Projects are the perfect opportunity for you to get involved. You can work on a project from a variety of fields like Biochemistry, Economics, Languages, Politics, or Social Sciences.

### Projects Supervised by a PhD Student
This summer you can get involved in one of the projects proposed by a postgraduate student from the Department of Statistics. If you are successful, you will work under their supervision with their offered additional support and guidance. It is the perfect opportunity for students who wish to discover what graduate research studies may involve. In addition, it bridges the gap between the post/undergraduate student communities.

### Projects Within Industry
With WDSS's industry links, we will offer several research projects with the aim to solve real-world business problems proposed by one of our partner companies. 

## Benefits
- Build valuable research project experience 
- Boost your CV 
- Perfect substitution for a summer internship 
- Learn a new programming language like Python, R or Julia 
- Improve your existing skills and extend your knowledge 
- Set the foundations for future research or publication
- Work closely with experienced data scientists, graduates, and PhD students

## What To Expect?
Should you be successful, you will be connected with a group of students or work as an individual researcher on a project of choice throughout the summer. WDSS offers access to resources and support from our experienced members and Subject Ambassadors, however, be prepared for a heavy focus on independent work. Once the project is complete, it will be published on our research blog and you can easily share it on your CV!

## Who Can Apply?
Our Summer Research Projects are open to any student. Due to the remote style of working, we encourage applications from students outside the University of Warwick. 

## What Are The Requirements and Levels of Difficulty?
The required skills and experience for each project vary and are listed in each of the project proposals. As a baseline, every project requires some coding skills in at least one of R or Python. If you completed one of our coding courses (Into-the-Tidyverse, Beginner's Python or Python for Data Science), then you can consider yourself a good candidate for a great number of projects. 

However, some of the projects will require further skills and knowledge not covered by these courses: i.e. expertise in statistics, familiarity with specific data science techniques (NLP, neural networks, dimensionality reduction), or specific domain knowledge.

For rough guidance, we label the proposed projects by the following levels of difficulty:
| Difficulty level | Interpretation                                                                                            |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *                | Beginner-friendly (undertake one of our coding courses and complete a mini-project in parallel)                                                                                 |
| **               | Basic coding/data science knowledge required                                                            |
| ***              | More independent research and intermediate coding skills required                    |
| ****             | Past project experience and specific skillset are expected                                     |
| *****            | Pushing the limits of what a student is capable of achieving. Hard projects, yet impressive outputs  |

**Note**: these difficulties correspond to the project as a whole. If a team is made of a domain expert and a technical lead, it is not the case that the domain expert requires the corresponding technical skills. 

## How To Apply?
Project proposals and their requirements will be released in batches and published regularly to our [recruitment website](recruitment.wdss.io). 
You can apply by sending your CV and answering two further questions in which you should demonstrate your motivation and suitability to undertake the project of interest. **Note:** You can apply for more than one project.

Results to be announced by the end of Term 3 (Saturday 3 July 2021).
