    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Aqueous solubility is a key physical property of interest in the medicinal and agrochemical industry. Low aqueous solubility of compounds can be a major problem in drug development, as <a href=\"https://biomedpharmajournal.org/vol13no2/the-importance-of-solubility-for-new-drug-molecules/\">more than 40% of newly developed chemicals are practically insoluble in water.</a> For a drug to be absorbed it needs to be contained in a solution at the site of the absorption and solubility is the main parameter that influences the bioavailability of a molecule. Many drug manufacturers are inclined more to produce oral drug products due to their ease of administration, lack of sterility constraints and high patient compliance, which causes them to prioritise bioavailability and therefore aqueous solubility.\n",
    "\n",
    "As designing and approving a new drug is an expensive, nearly decade-long process, new methods for the prediction of a compound's aqueous solubility prior to its synthesis could greatly facilitate the process of drug development. Aqueous solubility is also a major factor in the development of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides as highly soluble substances <a href=\"https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/publication/PI202\">are more likely to move through the soil in water than less-soluble substances</a>, therefore they are able to reach the plants and take effect more easily. This suggests that the agrochemical industry can also greatly benefit from new methods of estimating aqueous solubility of compounds without the presence of a physical sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a branch of computer science that focuses on the use of algorithms and data to imitate the way that humans learn. It allows us to create models that can predict a compound's aqueous solubility straight from its molecular structure without the presence of a physical sample. Not having to run sophisticated and computationally expensive physical simulations can greatly reduce the amount of time and funds spent in the process of drug discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning algorithms can be grouped into regressive algorithms used to predict a continious value (age, salary, etc.) and classification algorithms used to predict discrete values (male, female, etc.). Predicting a compound's aqueous solubility is a regression problem rather than a classification one and the model can be taught to predict a value based on a set of inputs in a process called supervised learning."

    "The entire project was completed using Python. We used the dataset ESOL, containing the solubilities of 1144 chemical compounds and their structures in the SMILES format. SMILES is a commonly used notation used for describing the structure of chemical compounds with short ASCII strings. The compounds contained in the dataset are mostly pesticide products, low molecular weight organic compounds, and heavy compounds."

    "## Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to observe which features have the most predictive power it was decided to train a linear regression model from the library `sklearn` to predict *log(solubility)*. Multiple linear regression is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression is to model the **linear** relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables and response (dependent) variables. Data was split into training and testing datasets with 80% of the data used for training the model. Metrics we used to quantify how well a model fits the dataset were *RMSE* and *R-Squared*.\n"

    "- $R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\text{RSS}}{\\text{TSS}}$, where RSS = sum of squares of residuals, TSS = total sum of squares of the values in the dataset. It tells us about the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. $R^2$ takes the values between 0 and 1. An $R^2$ of 1 indicates that the regression predictions perfectly fit the data.\n",

The predictive power of this simple linear model inspired us to create a more sophisticated neural network model for the same purpose.\n",

The models can be compared using this graph, showing the distribution of measured molecule solubility and predicted molecule solubility of both models.\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "Molecular machine learning methods for the prediction of chemical properties can have far-reaching benefits for industries relating to chemistry. They could greatly reduce the cost and time used in the process of drug development. Methods similar to ours can also be used to predict other chemical properties like lipophilicity or solvation free energy. \n",
    "While the accuracy of these methods may not always be perfect, they can still prove to be useful by giving researchers suggestions about whether the compounds they're researching fit their criteria. Until sophisticated and reliable molecular learning methods are widely recognised we can't greatly depend on them in research, however they can still serve as advisory tools. Conducting synthesis and running sophisticated tests isn't always the most viable option, therefore these methods can prove to be useful where time and budget is limited."
