    "## Project Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Random events happen without an underlying pattern, meaning no consistent algorithm can produce a series of truly random events. \n",
    "After numerous psychological tests, scientists found that people often approach the concept of randomness with underlying assumptions about its nature, usually ones that contradict its definition. \n",
    "Humans have an inherent tendency to look for predictability in anything they encounter to improve their understanding of it.\n",
    "Unfortunately, this instinct often leads to a paradox where one attempts to make sense of randomness as something predictable, worsening their understanding of it instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the development of statistical mathematics, we can “measure” the randomness of events with appropriate hypothesis testing methods.\n",
    "The motivation behind this project is to create a program that, with the help of hypothesis testing theory, grades a user’s ability to create plausible random sequences.\n",
    "This project is interested only in measuring randomness in human-generated binary sequences."

    "The test uses the proportion of **1**s to the sequence length as its only input, which carries no information about the arrangement of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",

    "Unlike the Wald-Wolfowitz test, the generalised runs test does not assume that samples come from a finite population and does not assume that the two outcomes are equally likely.\n",

    "Statisticians do not yet know the limiting distribution of runs in a Bernoulli trial sequence.\n",
