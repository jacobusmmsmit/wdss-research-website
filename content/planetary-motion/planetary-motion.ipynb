    "### The Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple (both in terms of the physics and the resulting visualisations), we restrict ourselves to a two-dimensional universe. We will, however, discuss how to generalise the methods demonstrated here to three dimensions at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any physics problem, we have to start with some assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these is assuming that all planetary bodies act as point masses. That is to say, even though the bodies have a non-zero radius and therefore an area, we assume that the entirety of their mass is located at the centre. This makes calculations related to gravitational forces far easier with minimal impact on the resulting values in most circumstances. If there are any collisions between two masses, they become one with a point mass equal to the sum of the two individual masses.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also assume that the forces acting on our planetary bodies are constant over very short durations. This allows us to use a simple set of equations known as SUVAT (more on this later) instead of relying on complex integral calculus. This assumption is largely reasonable, only failing substantially when we get close to massive bodies (such as a black hole or neutron star), at which point the outcome of motion (collision and merging) is essentially determined already.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also make some minor assumptions, such as treating all planetary bodies as circular.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under these assumptions, and given the initial positions, velocities, and masses of our bodies, our goal is to simulate the resulting planetary motion."

    "### Deriving Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "With our assumptions in place we can begin to calculate the trajectories of our planetary bodies. As discussed in the introduction to this piece, there is no closed form solution for the positions in a system of 3 or more bodies at any given time. That said, we can use our second assumption from above to accurately progress the motion one small timestep at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we take the positions and masses of the objects at any given timestep, and use these to calculate the instantaneous forces between all bodies in the simulation. From this, we can calculate accelerations, velocities and, finally, the positions of the bodies at the next timestep. At this point the process is repeated, building up a realistic simulation of planetary motion, piece-by-piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows that the first problem we need to solve is how to calculate the force acting on any particular body at an instant of time. The most straightforward method of doing this is to decompose the overall force into its $x$ and $y$ components using the trigonometric functions sine and cosine. This is because the coordinates used in our code are relative to the $x$ and $y$ axes, and so it is much simpler to update velocities and positions in these components.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, consider the initial positions of masses 1 and 2, the $x$ and $y$. It is relatively simple to calculate the displacement between the two bodies.\n",
    "\n",

    "is the distance between the two bodies (using Pythagoras' theorem). \n",

    "$$ a_1^{(x)} = \\frac{F_1^{(x)}}{M_1}$$\n",
    "\n",

These relate acceleration, current/new velocity, change in position, and time difference, in such a way that knowing any three gives you the others. We know our fixed timestep, the current velocity, and we just calculated the acceleration acting on the body, so we are good to go.\n",

The first major step would be to generate a simulation in three-dimensions. In order to do this, the force would have to be split into its three component forces in the $x$, $y$ and $z$ directions, thus allowing the calculation of the change in position/velocity in each direction.\n",

    "In the name of simplicity, many opportunities for efficiency have been deliberately missed in writing this code. To wrap-up this post, here is a list of a few ideas (in increasing complexity) that could increase the efficiency of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Due to Newton's second law, once we know the force acting on body $i$ by body $j$, we know the opposing force to be equal. We can therefore halve the number of force calculations we use.\n",
    "2. Base Python is notoriously slow, instead switching to NumPy, or better yet, JIT-compilation using Numba would offer a massive speed boost.\n",
    "3. Due to the nature of the problem, there is a lot of scope for parallelisation. An efficient solution would break up the motion calculations between cores to avoid downtime.\n",
    "4. For large simulations for $n$ >> 1 bodies, it may be worthwhile chunking the 'universe' up into grids based on the largest mass in the system, so that any planets in different grid cells have negligible impacts on each other and so can be omitted from the resultant force calculations."
